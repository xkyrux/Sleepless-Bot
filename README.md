# Sleepless Bot
 This is the official Sleepless Bot made by `Sleepless Kyru#7615`

If you see a bot with this code or looks exactly the same and they claim it to be their code, it is not true and you should not accept any downloads from them as it most likely altered from the original!

# Desktop Setup

**BOT SETUP**

**1.** Install [nodeJS LTS](https://nodejs.org/en/)

**2.** Open your data folder, open **settings.json** and fill in your bot credentials and choose a prefix!

**3.** Open up a command prompt window directing to your bot's root folder

**4.** Type **node bot.js** and hit enter!

Your terminal should say **bot is ready!** within a couple seconds. If it does not or you get any errors, please head to our [Discord](https://discord.gg/s5usdPf) for help!


**BOT UPDATE**

**1.** Copy your data folder to your desktop!

**2.** Download new zip from our GitHub

**3.** Copy paste FROM YOUR COPIED DATA FOLDER to your data folder in the zip you just downloaded --> **globals.json**, **players.json**, **servers.json**, **serverVars.json**, and **settings.json**... **DO NOT COPY COMMANDS OR EVENTS!!!**

You should be updated now! Go ahead and start your bot in the **NEW** bot folder. You can delete the old one if you want as you will not be using it anymore...
